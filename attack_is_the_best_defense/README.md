This is my directory for the ALX - Attack is the best defense assignment task and contains all my answer codes.

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!
