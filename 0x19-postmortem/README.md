All software systems eventually fail, and that failure may stem from a multitude of possible factors: security issues, hardware failure, bugs, human error and even traffic spikes. Instances of software systems failing are normal occurences, and are great opportunities for the software engineers to learn and improve to avoid a repeat of the same occurence.

A postmortem is a widely used tool in the tech industry. After any outage, the team in charge of the system will write a summary with 2 main goals in mind:
- Provide the rest of the company employees with easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. This helps the executive to understand what happened how the outage will impact the normal opperations.
- Ensure that the root cuase of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
